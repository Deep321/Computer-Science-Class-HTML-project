<font size="5"></i>Early life
Alexander Ovechkin is the son of Mikhail Ovechkin, a former professional 
football (soccer) player, and Tatyana Ovechkina, who won two Olympic gold 
medals while competing for the Soviet women's basketball team at the 1976 
Summer Olympics in Montreal and at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow.[1]

The first signs of Ovechkin's future came when two years old – while in a 
Soviet toy store, he grabbed a toy hockey stick and helmet and refused to let 
go. His parents treasure the picture to this day.[2] Whenever he saw a hockey 
game on TV, he "dropped all his toys" and ran to the TV, protesting strongly if 
his parents tried to change the channel.[citation needed] His parents say they 
knew he would be an athlete when he chose to run up the steps to their 10th 
floor apartment instead of taking the elevator.[citation needed] They also 
encouraged him to be athletic, sending him out to play at nearby soccer fields 
and basketball courts.[2]
Sergei, Ovechkin’s older brother, had initially introduced him to hockey, and 
Alexander enrolled in hockey school at the age of 8.[2] Soon after he began, 
however, he had to postpone his hockey career because his parents were unable 
to take him to the rink. But one of Ovechkin's coaches saw Ovechkin's talent 
and insisted to his parents that he should continue playing hockey.[citation 
needed] Sergei later died in a car accident when Alexander was only 10. A 
childhood friend claims this is one of the reasons Ovechkin is so passionate on 
the ice.[2]
Since he studied at the Military Institute for Border Guards, Ovechkin did not 
have to go through compulsory military service.[citation needed]
 Playing career
 <font color="green">Dynamo Moscow
Russian hockey teams begin building their systems from childhood. Ovechkin 
began playing in the Dynamo Moscow system and the age of 16, made his debut for 
the team in the Russian Superleague in the 2001-2002 season. In the 2003-2004 
season, he won the Superleague award for Best Left Wing and became the youngest 
Dynamo Moscow player to lead the team in scoring.
In 2004-2005, he missed nearly two months of play because of a shoulder injury 
sustained in the Gold Medal Game against Canada in the World Junior 
Championships.<br>
<hr width=100% size=10 font color="blue">
 <font size="5">Washington Capitals
Ovechkin was the first overall draft choice in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft, going 
to the Washington Capitals. He had been projected as the first overall pick for 
nearly two years[3] , and had earned comparison to Mario Lemieux.[4] He was so 
highly regarded, the Florida Panthers attempted to draft him in the 2003 NHL 
Entry Draft in the 9th round, even though his birthday was two days after the 
cut-off (September 15th, 1985). Rick Dudley, the general manager of the 
Panthers, claimed the pick was legitimate, saying that using leap-years 
Ovechkin was old enough.[4]
<font color="blue">
Following the 2004-05 NHL lockout, Alexander Ovechkin played his first game 
with the Capitals on October 5, 2005, scoring two goals in a 3-2 victory over 
Columbus. In a shootout against Anaheim, Ovechkin scored the winning goal to 
end the game at 5-4.
On January 13, 2006, in Anaheim, Ovechkin scored his first career hat trick 
against Jean-Sébastien Giguère of the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim to help 
Washington win the game.
On January 16, 2006, Alexander Ovechkin scored a goal that veteran hockey 
reporter Bill Clement called "one of the greatest goals of all time."[cite this 
quote] Knocked down by Paul Mara, a defenseman for the Phoenix Coyotes, then 
sliding on his back and facing away from the net, Ovechkin was able to hook the 
puck with one hand on his stick and slide it into the net past goalie Brian 
Boucher for his second goal of the night.</i><hr width=100% size=10 font

Roberto Luongo</h1></b></i></u></font><body bgcolor="black">
<br><br><Br>
</i><font size="5"><font color="blue">Roberto Luongo grew up in Montreal, 
Canada where he became interested in becoming a hockey goalie at a young age - 
he idolized former Edmonton Oilers goalie Grant Fuhr. Roberto started playing 
junior hockey
for the Val-d'Or Foreurs at 15 years old. In his second season with the club, 
Roberto led the Foreurs to a team-record 31 wins. He was drafted fourth overall 
in the 1997 NHL Draft to the New York Islanders
, but continued to play for his junior team. After five seasons with Val-d'Or, 
he was traded to the Arcadia-Bathurst Titans in 1998. His time with his new 
team didn't last long as he joined the Islanders later that season.

Roberto Luongo - NHL Career</font><font color="red">
Roberto played just 24 games with the Islanders before he was traded to the 
Florida Panthers in June 2000. He spent six very productive years in Florida, 
where he was an All Star and maintained a 90 percent save percentage nearly 
every season. In the summer of 2006, Roberto Luongo was traded to the Vancouver 
Canucks. He immediately signed a lucrative four-year, $27 million deal. He 
quickly proved he was worth the loot by breaking the club record with 38 wins. 
Roberto was also voted in by the fans as the started of the 2007 NHL All Star 
Game and at the end of the season was nominated for three major awards. His 
stellar goaltending helped the Canucks reach the second round of the playoffs 
where they fell to the eventual Stanley Cup Champions, the Anaheim Ducks.
Roberto Luongo - Show Stopper
Roberto Luongo is one of the most entertaining players in the game today. He 
has incredible reflexes and has a knack for making spectacular saves. He is a 
fan favorite not only in Vancouver but throughout the league. Roberto is a 
winner and don't be surprised if he becomes the reason the Canucks become 
Stanley Cup Champions in the near future!
